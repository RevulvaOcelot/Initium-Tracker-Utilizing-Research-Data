So. Here we are again. I still suck at programming, but you can bet your ass I made this easier to use and modify. 

I would of course prefer to keep this in the group, but as always, it's up to you. 

Features:

  * Chat-based controls
  * HP alerts when you're in danger
  * Displays currently unequipped items
  * Tracks your stats per hit
  * Autocalculates your estimated max stats based on your stat/hit data (code stolen from: http://www.bricksforchange.com/stats-calculator.)
  * Displays your current stats, and displays if they're ideal (based on http://initium.wikia.com/wiki/Staub's_Rerolling_Guide) CURRENTLY ONLY CHECKS ATTACK NUMBERS 2, 16 AND 50.
  * I forgot if there's anything else. I don't care.



NOTE:

  * Be careful with replacing the script. In my testing I renamed the script and added a new one with the same old name and the data didn't carry over. It was still there, but it's in the old, renamed script.
  * Careful with resetting data too. You lose everything stored (old rerolled characters, etc.)
  * Care with using it in general. I haven't tested it extensively. 
  * When using an existing (not fresh) character, make some 100-ish attacks to help the estimated max stats take form.


Probably future features:

  * Importing data
  * Maybe an in-game map? Probably not
  * I don't know I'm out of ideas. Hit me up if you have any, or make the change and share.
