# Initium-Tracker-Utilizing-Research-Data
The project formerly known as IPISSED (Improved Packaged Initium Super Sizzling Enhancement Device)

New name credited to Liam and I! 

So. Here we are again. I still suck at programming, but you can bet your ass I made this easier to use and modify. 

I would of course prefer to keep this in the group, but as always, it's up to you. 

Features:
Chat-based controls
HP alerts when you're in danger
Displays currently unequipped items
Tracks your stats per hit
Autocalculates your estimated max stats based on your stat/hit data (code stolen from: http://www.bricksforchange.com/stats-calculator.)
Displays your current stats, and displays if they're ideal (based on http://initium.wikia.com/wiki/Staub's_Rerolling_Guide) CURRENTLY ONLY CHECKS ATTACK NUMBERS 2, 16 AND 50.
I forgot if there's anything else. I don't care.


NOTE:

Be careful with replacing the script. In my testing I renamed the script and added a new one with the same old name and the data didn't carry over. It was still there, but it's in the old, renamed script.
Careful with resetting data too. You lose everything stored (old rerolled characters, etc.)
Care with using it in general. I haven't tested it extensively. 
When using an existing (not fresh) character, make some 100-ish attacks to help the estimated max stats take form.

Probably future features:
Importing data
Maybe an in-game map? Probably not
I don't know I'm out of ideas. Hit me up if you have any, or make the change and share.
